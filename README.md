IMAGE EDITOR
This image editor which was created based on my Image code. I added a graphical user interface to it using the Tkinter library. In order for everything to work well without any problems, you will have to download all the files that I uploaded to this repository. Create a separate folder for them and upload there. And using VS code open that folder. Just in case, run all the modules, and at the end, run main.py.
On the image you can see the GUI itself


IT HAS 6 FUNCTIONS
1. Add Watermark - adds a watermark to the image you have selected.
2. Black and White - adds a watermark to the image you have selected.
3. Resize - resizes the image.
4. MIX - all these 1-3 functions are added to the image.
5. Copyright Section - it is the Copyright notification.
6. Exit - quit the GUI.
For example let's take the "Add Watermark" funtion
Firstly you should click on the button


And then you will have two buttons. First is the "Select Image" button, which we need. Second is the "Return to Menu" button


Select your image


And finally save the file


CODE CHANGES
If you want to change the watermark text. You can change in watermark.py
